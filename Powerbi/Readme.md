OTT Power BI Dashboard:

This project is about creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for an OTT (Over-the-Top) platform. The dashboard presents insights into user engagement, content performance, subscription data, and more. It provides a powerful, data-driven view of the platform's key metrics to help decision-makers understand trends and optimize strategies.
