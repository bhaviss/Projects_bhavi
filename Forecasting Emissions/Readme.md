Forecasting CO2 Emissions
Project Description:

This project focuses on forecasting CO2 emissions using machine learning models. By analyzing historical emissions data and various factors that contribute to CO2 output, we can predict future emissions. The goal of this project is to understand the trends in CO2 emissions and provide actionable insights for environmental planning.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Historical data on CO2 emissions and related environmental factors.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data for use in machine learning models.
Modeling: Building regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to predict future CO2 emissions.
Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Technologies Used:

Python (for machine learning and data preprocessing)
Scikit-learn (for regression models)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
How to Run:

Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Clone the repository or download the Python file forecast_co2.py.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python forecast_co2.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and provide CO2 emissions forecasts.
