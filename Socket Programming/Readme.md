Socket Programming:

The Socket Programming project demonstrates the basics of network communication between a client and a server. It involves using sockets to establish a communication channel over a network, enabling two devices to send and receive data. The project includes both a client and a server that can communicate with each other over TCP/IP.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Socket Library: Python's built-in socket library
Networking Protocol: TCP/IP
Operating System: Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)
